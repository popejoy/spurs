# SPurS Project: Identifying Shifts in Purifying Selection
Sites in the genome under strong [purifying selection](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/negative-selection-1136) are highly conserved (invariant) across species, regardless of their phylogenetic relationship. In contrast, SPurS sites exhibit conservation among species belonging to the same group or taxonomic clade, and variation between species in different groups or clades.

For example, a site with one amino acid in mammals and a different amino acid in birds represent a likely *shift* from one residue to another between the two species groups, which has been conserved under purifying selection over time.

The SPurS program calculates a Psi-value (Fig.1) for each site in a protein alignment, and the results can be visualized in SPurS plots (Fig.2, below) by using the [Genomic Hyperbrowser SPurS tool](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/spurs).

When compared to a matched simulated dataset, these results can be compared to determine whether proteins are enriched for SPurS sites. These sites are likely involved in speciation, or divergence between species, and are thus highly informative for evolutionary genomics.
