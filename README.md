# SPurS Project: Identifying Shifts in Purifying Selection
Sites in the genome under strong [purifying selection](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/negative-selection-1136) are highly conserved (invariant) across species, regardless of their phylogenetic relationship. In contrast, SPurS sites exhibit conservation among species belonging to the same group or taxonomic clade, and variation between species in different groups or clades.

My program to detect these shifts across different groups of species, *SPurS* is designed to elucidate proteins that are enriched for changes that segregate between taxonomic groups. Sites driving these changes are likely involved in speciation, or divergence between species, and are thus highly informative from a functional evolution perspective.
